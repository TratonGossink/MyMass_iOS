# MyMass_iOS

This is a body mass index app to determine the approximate body mass of the input information. 

### About
This app was built as a part of my online iOS development bootcamp from Angela Yu on Udemy. I took some of this app and made it my own. I design the UI, color scheme & app icon for this app. This project allowed me to learn how to use slide indicators, screen segues, MVC structuring, and much more. 
The UI/UX is all original by my design and the background color changes depending upon the outcome of the results delivered.
